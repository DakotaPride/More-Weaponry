# Mob Cores
This is something that will be expanded upon later on, most likely later on past 1.19 or during 1.19, which is the estimated time that the "Bosses of The Plague" will be added.
Mob Cores will be used in order to create Essence Cirtict Weapons, which are in the latest bug fix (2/18/2022), via using the Core Forge. You will be able to right-click on the
Core Forge with any item with the item tag, "mob_core", and get the respective item back.

Using, for example, the Wretched Mob Core on the Core Forge, you will recieve a Powered Mob Core, which has the ability Wretchedness. When you use this on a Cirtict Tool in a
Smithing Table, you will get an Essence Cirtict Weapon with that same ability.


# Powered Mob Core Abilities
Each Powered Mob Core has it's own ability, as stated.

A Powered Mob Core crafted using a Wretched Mob Core will have the ability "Wretchedness", which gives slowness and poisoning to the opponent.

A Powered Mob Core crafted using a Maiden Mob Core will have the ability "Siren's Call", which gives nausea and withering to the opponent.

A Powered Mob Core crafted using a Plagued Mob Core will have the ability "Missionary", which gives poisoning and blindness to the opponent.

A Powered Mob Core crafted using a Wicked Mob Core will have the ability "Voided", which gives darkness(in 1.19) and withering or blindness(pre-1.19) and withering to the opponent.

A Powered Mob Core crafted using a Suppressed Mob Core will have the ability "Explosion", which gives slowness and weakness to the opponent.

A Powered Mob Core crafted with all above Mob Cores has all abilities as well as can be used to craft a more advanced set of tools and armor, which will be added versions
released during 1.19, and may be put into beta pre-1.19.


# Essence Cirtict Items/Tools
Essence Cirtict Tools cannot be currently crafted, however are implmented into the creative menu and can still be accessed inside of the creative menu. These tools take on
any abilities that the Powered Mob Core used to craft them has. For example, if a Power Mob Core that has the ability "Wretchedness" was used to craft it, then the tool would
have that ability as well.
