## Translating
Hello! I am currently looking for translators! Specifically French (Canada), as while there are only minor differences, I want to make sure that this mod can be enjoyed without language barriers! If you would like to help translate this mod, feel free to create a bug report providing the language file (text form or file download) and I will make sure to get to it! (As mentioned on the Curseforge page, you will not be paid, but will be labelled as contributor on the mod)
