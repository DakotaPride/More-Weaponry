- Bleeding Effect Causes Target To Instantly Kill The Attacker // (MW-#26-A)
    Details: Replicated (originally) by attacking a slime (of any size that can deal damage) with any weapon/tool that can have the bleeding enchantment applied,
             which then applies the Bleeding effect to the opponent.
    More Details: After fixing this issue, I came across a side effect of it.
        - Bleeding Effect Causes Target To Not Be Able To Deal Damage (was not the intention) // (MW-#26-B)
- Numbing Effect Had Similar Issue To (MW-#26-B) // (MW-#027)
    Details: This has since been revised, as the actual intention resulting in this bug was to just lower the damage done, not remove it entirely.
